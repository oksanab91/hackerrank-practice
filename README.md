# HackerRank Practice Solutions

Some examples of problem solving during my practice on the HackerRank site.


### Repeated string:
Find the number of letter a's in the first *n* letters of infinite string.

### Counting portions: 
Calculate the number of downlevel portions in a path - sequence of consecutive steps of *n* steps string.
(*U* - uphill, *D* - downhill steps)


### Find the path:
Determine the minimum number of steps in *n* binary integers, *c*, to get from the starting postion to the last one.
*c* is Array of items numbered *0* if they are safe or *1* if they must be avoided.
Can step on any safe item having a number that is equal to the number of the current item plus *1* or *2*. 

### Equalize the array:
Determine the minimum number of elements to delete in ann array of integers to get all remaining elements are equal.
